# Express.js Note Tracker (Mod-11-Challenge)

## Description

Express.js: Note Tracker, or Module 11's Challenge, is to modify existing starter code to create an application via Express.js (backend) that can be used to write, save and delete notes. Data will be saved and obtained via a JSON file. Users (frontend) should be able to input new notes (title and text), save the new notes to the deployed site, click on pre-existing notes (saved on left hand side), clear notes that are being created, and delete notes that already exist. This challenge will test our ability to utilize the Express.js, build the back end of a deployed site, connect the back end to front end, and deploy the site on Heroku.

## Installation

Create new repository and utilize start code from Module-11-Challenge (i.e., code from miniature-eureka). Start code includes: .gitignore, package.json, db.json, index and notes html, css and index js. Add additional javascript files needed such as server.js, api and html routes, and ID method. Installation also includes an npm install for express and other programs in package.json (creates package-lock.json and node_modules). Installation also includes previously installed nodemon as well as deployment to Heroku.
